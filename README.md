# Malware Analysis lab 

<h2>Description</h2>
Malware Analysis Lab Project. Malware Analysis lab, often used for educational and research purposes, is a controlled environment where security professionals, researchers, and students can safely analyze and study malware. The lab provides a secure and isolated space for dissecting malicious software to understand its behavior, functionality, and potential impact. Below is a detailed description of a typical Malware Analysis Lab. Even though I won't go through how to make an Analysis lab step by step I will give a Lab setup and then share my Analysis tool results. I'm also analyzing the Zeus Banking Trojan Malware
<br />


<h2>Lab Setup:</h2>
Isolation: The lab is set up in an isolated network segment to prevent malware from spreading beyond the lab environment. This isolation ensures that the analysis doesn't impact the production network.


Physical or Virtual Machines: The lab includes physical or virtual machines where malware samples can be executed and analyzed. Virtualization is often preferred for its flexibility and ease of snapshotting for analysis.

Network Infrastructure: The lab may include routers, switches, and firewalls to mimic a network environment and monitor network traffic generated by malware.

I did a couple of things differently in this Malware Analysis than what people usually do in a Malware analysis. Normally you'll have an Advance Static Analysis and you also have a huge document where you compare the malware and its qualities. This was my first Malware Analysis Lab and I just wanted to show off my skills so it's really basic   <br/>
